[![Cheat SmartExam](/assets/article_images/about/SmartExam.jpg)][6]

This **application SmartWatch 2** allows reading text on the watch in low light, which is achieved with a black background so you can read perfectly without anyone noticing. The texts per page should be small to avoid getting lost in reading and copy faster. **Unfortunately I lost my signature file and I can't update it**.
