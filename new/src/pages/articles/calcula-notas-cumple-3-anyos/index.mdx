When I presented the second version of [Grade Calculator][1], I added a section of improvements mentioning features that could be added, and that's what's new in the 3rd version. I also promised for version 3 that people would be able to share subjects between them, but that hasn't been possible yet. I also talked about a web version that won't see the light for now at least, but there is a surprise...

Between version 2 and version 3, I added a new functionality to be able to log in and have your subjects always with you in the cloud, so even if you change phones you can access your subjects.

In this version, **I removed the *DrawerLayout* (the sliding side bar) and added a Bottom Bar**, similar to [Spaces][2] because it perfectly suits the functionalities of [Grade Calculator][1], where you need to add subjects and evaluation groups, and besides, the button was already in the center before, which is great.

In the post about version 2 of [Grade Calculator][1], I also said that removing the *DrawerLayout* improved the UX and I made [a survey][3] to see if [Grade Calculator][1] version 2 was better than the new version. While I was expecting people to vote for the new version, suddenly everyone loves the *DrawerLayout*. However, given its functionality and how it's used, with the new design, everything is clearer and easier to use with one finger.

## Profile
<Image src={profile} />

The profile screen is the same screen that appears when you slid the *DrawerLayout*, showing your list of subjects and account information.

## Subject
<Image src={subject} />

This is the same screen that showed a subject with its list of evaluation groups.

Changing subjects is now faster and easier to use, with everything at hand.

It's still pending for the future to be able to share subjects since it would be great if someone could create a subject with their rules and share it with an entire class, but for now we have to settle for thinking that you have VIP functionality if you're in my Computer Engineering course at UPV ;)

You can download [Grade Calculator][1] and let me know what you think.
