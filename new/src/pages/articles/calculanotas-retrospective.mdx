## Short Story
Every exam period at the university, I had to calculate the grades I needed to get to pass. For this, I had to look at the structure of each subject and calculate the grade counting practicals, assignments and exams.

Something like, 60% exam, 30% practicals, 10% assignments.
Then the practicals had different percentages, practical 1: 10%, practical 2: 9%, practical 3: 11%.

I spent too much time and preferred to have an easier way to do it... So I created calculators where you can specify the structure of each subject, add your grades and see what minimum grade you needed to get to pass.

I shared it with all my friends and people used it.

## Promotion
A year later after the success of [Facemash UPV][1], I used Facemash success to promote the app.

This gave me large exposure to thousands of students around the world.

## Why I Built This
I wanted to solve a problem I had, and learn Advanced Architecture development in Android.

So as soon as I didn't need the application myself, and I had learned advanced architecture development, I stopped maintaining it.

Lifespan: 3 years.

## Learnings
1. Publication process in the App Store
2. Material design
3. If it doesn't generate money, it won't be maintained.
4. Work on support emails and continuous changes, through years.
