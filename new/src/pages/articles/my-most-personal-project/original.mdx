My journey into electronics began with simple curiosity, and then suddenly I found myself trying to make electronic solutions for my own problems at home, building better IoT devices. I felt the current software for home IoT devices was inadequate and I knew I could do it much better.

This started by turning my fan on and off, then my home lights. I realized the hardware part was going to be very challenging because I couldn't make the devices smaller and smaller.

So I pivoted to different electronic devices, like an irrigation system for vertical gardens. Since they need a lot of maintenance, I wanted to create a system that identifies which parts are drier due to poor irrigation system design on walls, which is very typical. This way, installers wouldn't need to make unnecessary trips since they would have a dashboard for every customer analyzing what could be wrong in their vertical garden.

This led to creating a very ambitious hardware project, with many components, different processors and sensors. I enjoyed it for many years.

I let my imagination run wild without any customer feedback, and created massive hardware that was difficult to build myself. I ended up pivoting again when a friend who was working at a company installing garage doors asked me to improve the software of hardware they were buying from China.

After many years of learning electronics, starting from zero knowledge, I ended up realizing I wasn't an electronics expert, and I didn't know how to manufacture hardware at a larger scale, as my friend needed to start with 10 devices, then 50 devices, and so on.

So why not hack the hardware from China and include my own firmware to connect to my mobile app? I could use all my previous experience writing processor code and server communications to focus on what I know best, which is software.
