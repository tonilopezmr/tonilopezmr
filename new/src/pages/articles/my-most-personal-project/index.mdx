## Long Story Short

My journey into hardware started with IoT home automation. Frustrated with existing smart home solutions, I began building my own devices, starting with simple fan and light controls.

[Bacota](https://bacota.com) was born.

When hardware miniaturization proved challenging, I pivoted to vertical garden irrigation systems. I built sensors and dashboards to help installers identify dry spots and maintenance issues remotely. The project grew complex with multiple components as I explored the technical possibilities.

However, I made the mistake of building without customer feedback. When a friend needed improved software for garage door hardware from China, I realized I wasn't equipped for hardware manufacturing at scale.

This led to my final approach - modifying existing Chinese hardware with custom firmware. This leveraged my software strengths while applying everything I'd learned about hardware. It was the perfect balance of practicality and innovation.

## Why I Built This

This project was deeply personal. After losing a friend who worked in electronics, **someone important to me, told me I could never work with electronics without going to university**. Her dismissive comment sparked my determination to _prove her wrong_.

I started learning Arduino development to honor my friend's memory. What began as defiance became a journey of discovery, where I found magic in combining software and hardware to create something meaningful ✨

## Learnings

1. > Looking back, I realize I didn't truly tried to the Bacota company - my focus was entirely on learning and proving myself. I neglected crucial business aspects like customer development, seeking funding, or building a team. My passion for mastering electronics overshadowed the practical steps needed for a successful hardware startup.

2. I invested more than €10,000 thinking I failed at building a company. The reality is that **I invested in myself** to demonstrate I could do it, **not in the company.**

3. **I discovered I'm capable of anything I set my mind to** - from building electronic devices from scratch and understanding the physics behind them, to developing full-stack software solutions, hacking hardware bypasing my firmware, creating 3D objects and more.

4. I did everything myself, I didn't not try to build a team or delegate anything, just EGO driven. 

5. All this journey was about my EGO and me.

6. Work-life balance is crucial for the long term, burnout is real. **For 4 years, I juggled this project alongside a full-time job, sacrificing nearly every weekend**, working late into the night, and getting minimal sleep. Looking back, I should have taken more time to rest and recharge.
